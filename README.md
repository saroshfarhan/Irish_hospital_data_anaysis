1.  We analysed the patient discharge data and saw that women in the four counties selected are more in numbers than men, this might be due to low immunity or women like to frequently go for health checkups than their male counterparts.
2.  Dublin and County had the highest average length of stay by patients, this was because Dublin being the capital and having more multi-speciality hospitals can have longer stay for patient for proper nursing and condition improving than other smaller counties.
3.  COVID-19 had an impact on the number of daycases and the total cases per year, we saw a huge spike in 2019 and then again in 2021 as COVID came in 2 waves and the data shows the increase suggesting the need for healthcare rose sharply in the pandemic.
4.  We also saw the comparison of pre-covid daycases and in covid daycases and we saw a huge increment in the number of people coming for checkups.
5.  Overall the healthcare system worked as normal in other years and and COVID-19 really tested the limits of the healthcare systems.
